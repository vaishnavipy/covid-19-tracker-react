Built this Covid-19 tracker with data from [Mathroid](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api)

Used [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to build the bar charts to display the country-wise cases. And used the [Countup Timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countup) to create the timer effect on the Number of cases.
